1. nspanel_blueprint.yaml - v3.5
2. nspanel_eu.tft or nspanel_us.tft - v3.5

## Breaking changes
1. New requirement: Home Assistant 2023.5.0 or later

&nbsp;
## Overview of all changes
1. Alarm control panel
2. Support to sensor display precision from Home Assistant (#880)
3. Filtered device list
&nbsp;
## Details of all changes

### 1. Alarm control panel
recommend api-encryption: https://esphome.io/components/api.html#configuration-variables
and, of course warn the user that this is a possible security issue.
Anyways - this is also done with many other projects, AND it would require that a possible hacker is already inside the internal (or mayby iot) (W)LAN - and at this point....
recommend to have a big warning, and that the user has to take care about e.g.:
- secure internal network
- split internal networks: IOT, Guest, Internal, Management, ...
- enable api-encryption

### 2. Support to sensor display precision from Home Assistant
Now the values shown in your panel will follow the [sensor display precision](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/03/01/release-20233/#sensor-display-precision) provided by Home Assistant.
=> If you have problems with a value exceeding the available space in your panel, please reduce the number of decimals using Home Assistant [sensor display precision](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/03/01/release-20233/#sensor-display-precision).

### 3. Filtered device list
When selecting the NSPanel on the automation, only ESP32 devices will be shown, making easier to find your panel.
